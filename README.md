# DevOps-Interview-Questions
---

### **1. What is a statefile?**
- **Definition**: A statefile in Terraform (`terraform.tfstate`) is a file that tracks the real-world state of your infrastructure.  
- **Purpose**: 
  - Keeps a record of resources provisioned by Terraform.
  - Determines the differences between actual and desired states during a `terraform apply`.  

---

### **2. Where do you store the statefile?**
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Store in a **remote backend** for team collaboration and safety.
  - **Options**: AWS S3 with DynamoDB locking, Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.
  - **Example**:
    ```hcl
    backend "s3" {
      bucket         = "my-tf-state"
      key            = "statefile/terraform.tfstate"
      region         = "us-east-1"
      dynamodb_table = "state-locking"
    }
    ```

---

### **3. What is a null resource in Terraform?**
- **Definition**: A `null_resource` is a placeholder resource that doesn’t manage any actual infrastructure but allows you to execute provisioners or run scripts.  
- **Use Case**:  
  - Run commands or scripts without creating infrastructure.
  - Example:
    ```hcl
    resource "null_resource" "example" {
      provisioner "local-exec" {
        command = "echo 'Hello, Terraform!'"
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **4. CI/CD workflow**
- **Definition**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery pipelines automate code integration, testing, and deployment.  
- **Steps**:
  1. **Code Integration**: Developers push code to version control (e.g., Git).
  2. **Build**: Tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI build the code.
  3. **Test**: Automated testing ensures code quality.
  4. **Deploy**: Artifacts are deployed to staging/production environments.
- **Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD.

---

### **5. Terraform code to deploy an EC2 instance**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-Instance"
  }
}
```
- **Command**:  
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```

---

### **6. What will appear in the Terraform plan if you comment out a resource block?**
- **Outcome**: Terraform will show that the resource is marked for destruction.  
- Example:
  - If you comment out an EC2 instance resource, Terraform generates a plan to destroy it.

---

### **7. Script to find the largest and smallest elements in an array**
- **Bash**:
  ```bash
  arr=(3 5 7 2 8)
  max=${arr[0]}
  min=${arr[0]}
  for i in "${arr[@]}"; do
    if [[ $i -gt $max ]]; then max=$i; fi
    if [[ $i -lt $min ]]; then min=$i; fi
  done
  echo "Max: $max, Min: $min"
  ```
- **Python**:
  ```python
  arr = [3, 5, 7, 2, 8]
  print("Max:", max(arr), "Min:", min(arr))
  ```

---

### **8. ENTRYPOINT vs CMD in a Dockerfile**
- **ENTRYPOINT**: Defines the default executable for the container. Arguments passed during runtime are appended.  
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
    ```
- **CMD**: Specifies default arguments for `ENTRYPOINT` or provides a command to execute if `ENTRYPOINT` is not defined.
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    CMD ["--port", "8080"]
    ```

---

### **9. ADD vs COPY in Dockerfile**
- **COPY**:
  - Simple copy from the host to the container.
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    COPY file.txt /app/
    ```
- **ADD**:
  - Supports extraction of tar archives and downloading remote URLs.
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    ADD archive.tar.gz /app/
    ```
